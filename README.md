# Correlation between Covid-19 and Economic
## Problem Definition
Covid-19 has attacked humankind for nearly ten months that not only infects millions of people but also affects all aspects of our life. The main reason for those strugglings is we didnâ€™t have enough knowledge about the virus to effectively prevent it. If we know exactly what and when an industry sector is affected by the pandemic, we could have better strategies to address the problem. This project visualized the changes of covid-19 cases and deaths along with related features such as stock prices, unemployment rate, business bankruptcy in the same time frame. For each timeframe, we classify an interesting feature into groups.

In specific, we collect covid-19 data source and other relevant data sources that represent our economy and healthcare system such as stock prices, unemployment rate, health care indexes.  visualizes the changes of covid-19 cases along with other interesting features in a same time series. 

This project provides the visual view for those questions:
* The effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the stock market.
  * The most raised and dropped stocks 
  * The most stable/unstable stocks
  * The most promising stocks
* The effects of COVID-19 on the labor market ([source](https://www.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm))
  * Top 10 occupations are most effected by Covid-19?
  * What are the unimployment rates by race, occupation during the pendemic?
  * How many working people have to take care of children who cannot go to school?

headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}
data = json.dumps({"seriesid": ['CUUR0000SA0','SUUR0000SA0'],"startyear":"2011", "endyear":"2014"})
p = requests.post('https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/', data=data, headers=headers)
json_data = json.loads(p.text)
for series in json_data['Results']['series']:
    x=prettytable.PrettyTable(["series id","year","period","value","footnotes"])
    seriesId = series['seriesID']
    for item in series['data']:
        year = item['year']
        period = item['period']
        value = item['value']
        footnotes=""
        for footnote in item['footnotes']:
            if footnote:
                footnotes = footnotes + footnote['text'] + ','
       'if 'M01' <= period <= 'M12':'
            x.add_row([seriesId,year,period,value,footnotes[0:-1]])
    output = open(seriesId + '.txt','w')
    output.write (x.get_string())
    output.close()
```
