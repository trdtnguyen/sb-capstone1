# Correlation between Covid-19 and Economic
Updated: Added story telling [Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1af-YRE0olJoWg0lmaxU_24MULDHB_1eP6vQqhRHNPLw/edit?usp=sharing) that walks you through the progress of building this project.
## Quick Start
Clone the repository
```
$ git clone 
$ cd sb-capstone1
```
### Running in docker container:
```
$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```
### Running in your local machine:

***Step 1: Create and activate a virtual envirionment***
```
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.8 vevn
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Note: To avoid Python version error due to differences of python version in  Spark driver and Spark worker, following below notes:
* Ensure your python in Spark has the same version as the one in your veritual environment.
* Ensure `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` point to the same python bin.

***Step 2: Install Python packages***
```
$ (venv) pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
***Step 3: Setup Database***
This project use mysql as the back-end database. Change the `config.cnf` to match your mysql settings:
```
[DATABASE]
MYSQL_DATABASE=covid19cor
AIRFLOW_DATABASE=airflowdb
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword
MYSQL_USER=myusername
MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysqlpassword
```

Create database and tables:

```
$ mysqladmin -u root -p create covid19cor
$ mysql -u root -p covid19cor < sql/create_table.sql
```

***Step 4: Run ETL manually***
Before running the ETL, ensure your Spark driver and workers are started and configurated properly.
```
$ python tasks/etl_test.py
```

***Step 5: Config and start front-end Flask App***
Change Flask's configuration in `config.cnf` file to match yours settings:
```
[API]
API_HOST=<your_ip> # such as 192.168.0.2
API_PORT=8082
```

Start Flask web server
```
$ python flaskapp/app.py
```
***Step 5: Access dashboard***
After the flask app started, open your browser with url: `http://<API_HOST>:<API_PORT>` for example `http://192.168.0.2:8082/`. 


## Techniques
This section list common Data Engineering techniques and general programming techniques used in this project.
#### ETL
* Extract data source using various methods such as pandas' Datareader, parsing HTML page, API.
* Manipulate Spark's Dataframe and pandas Dataframe to load, cleaning, transforming data from raw tables to dimensional and fact tables.
   * Add/remove columns into/from a Dataframe
   * Transpose Dataframe's columns into rows
   * Aggregate data from daily frequency into montly frequency
   * Handling null values (filling null with previous non-null value) using Window functions.
#### Data pipeline scheduling
* Exploit Apache Airflow to schedule ETL tasks
#### Database Design, SQL
* Using MySQL as the back-end RDBMS for data wareshouse with star schema.
* The front-end apps (ETL tasks) use ODBC connector (for pyspark) and SqlAchemy for pandas.
* Data transform in ETL tasks combine both SQL and pyspark's APIs.
#### Front-end techniques: Flask, jQuery, Chart.js, HTML/javascript/CSS
* Project support various front-end interfaces such as RESTful API using Flask, Tablue, and Jupyter notebook
* Drawing charts using Chart.js + jQuery
* 
#### Docker, docker-compose
* Packing flask, airflow, spark, mysql into one docker container
* App image wait for database image ready

#### Python programming
* Object-oriented programming in Python.
* Load configuration values through config.cnf file
* Exploit singleton desgin pattern to use a GlobalUtil class as a common shared utility between other classes in the project
* Logging
* Unit test using pytest.
